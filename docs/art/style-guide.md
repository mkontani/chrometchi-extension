# Chrometchi art style guide

Style A: retro pop, 32×32, thick black outline, flat colors. Everything in the popup (characters, UI and backgrounds) uses this one style.

## Approved anchors (Gate A)

![anchors](anchors.png)

From left: `baby_puni`, then the egg patterns `plain`, `dots`, `zigzag` and `stars`.

- `src/assets/sprites/baby_puni/idle0.png` is the reference for every character. New sprites should match its outline weight, eye size and level of shading.
- `src/assets/sprites/egg/<pattern>/idle0.png`: all four patterns were adopted. The egg shows `EGG_PATTERNS[(generation - 1) % 4]` (`src/data/eggs.ts`), so each new egg has a different shell.

## Palette

![palette](palette.png)

There are 32 colors, listed in `src/assets/palette.json`. Every sprite is snapped to this palette with `reduce_colors(palette_image=docs/art/palette.png)`, and `npx tsx scripts/art/check.ts --palette <files>` must pass.

## Characters

Generation params: `create_image_pixen(width 32, height 32, no_background true, outline 'single color black outline', detail 'low detail', direction 'south', view 'side')`.

Prompt template (fill `{motif}` from `FORMS`):

```
cute {motif}, chibi virtual pet creature, round simple body, big sparkly eyes, rosy cheeks, front view, full body, centered, thick black outline
```

Poses come from `edit_image_pixen` on the approved `idle0`. Snap all 7 frames of a character to the palette together in one `reduce_colors` call.

| pose | description |
|---|---|
| idle1 | same character mid-bounce, body squashed 1-2px shorter and wider, same colors |
| happy | same character overjoyed, eyes closed as happy arcs, mouth open smiling, arms up |
| eat | same character eating, mouth wide open chewing |
| sick | same character sick, pale tint, swirly dizzy eyes, sweat drop |
| sleep | same character asleep, eyes closed lines, relaxed, slightly slumped |
| sad | same character sad, teary eyes, frowning, drooping |

## Eggs

- **Eggs never have a face** (no eyes, mouth or cheeks). This is owner feedback from Gate A.
- Do not use the character template for eggs, because it adds eyes and cheeks. Even with "no face" in the prompt, `create_image_pixen` still drew a face on 4 out of 4 tries. Make egg variants with `edit_image_pixen` starting from `egg/plain/idle0.png`, with instructions like "add …, keep the same egg shape, … No face."
- `idle1` (the wobble frame) for each pattern: "same egg tilted slightly to the right".

## Do / don't

- Do keep a 1px black outline around the whole silhouette, flat fills with at most one shade step, and a transparent background (`check.ts` rejects opaque corners and half-transparent pixels).
- Do review every candidate at 4× (128px, as in the popup) before approving it.
- Don't draw faces on eggs.
- Don't copy or closely imitate characters or names from existing franchises. Renamed examples: Akubiba, Horimo, Custa.
- Don't use fine detail or soft gradients. The old art looked coarse and cheap, and the goal is a simple, clean, cute Tamagotchi-like look.
